With my thoughts scattered among obscure Strava activity titles[^1], journal
entries backfilled from days in the future, and absurd messenger group chats
(where I send the occassional non sequitur article link so that I'm contributing
something other than memes for once), it only makes sense to organize and
compile some of my reads, animated media, and soundtracks that prompted
these thoughts in the first place.

Lots of these pieces served as my escapes from the world. Within these
escapes, I found a love for postmodern literature[^2] and critical theory.
Without any delay, here are my favorites from this year.

[^1]:
    Here is a shameless plug to [follow my
    Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/rexledesma) so I can be the influencer
    I've always wanted to be.

[^2]:
    Hence the multiple appearances of David Foster Wallace, and the new use of
    side notes in my blog.

### Fiction

- _The Soul is Not a Smithy_ by David Foster Wallace
- _The Castle_ by Franz Kafka
- _Private Citizens_ by Tony Tulathimutte
- _Forever Overhead_ by David Foster Wallace
- _Good Old Neon_ by David Foster Wallace[^3]
- _The Depressed Person_ by David Foster Wallace
- _Pnin_ by Vladimir Nabokov[^4]

[^3]:
    I still remember listening to [this
    narration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f-Q9GHmJGc) after an unsettling
    first read. [A tour of the city by
    bike](https://www.strava.com/activities/4218502396) took just enough time to fit
    in a meditation on this brilliant story. With each subsequent interview of David
    Foster Wallace that I listen to, this account becomes increasingly disturbing.

[^4]:
    Also, I absolutely adored [this essay (written by Emily
    Webb)](https://www.lagrange.edu/resources/pdf/citations/2017/14_Final_English_Webb.pdf)
    on unreliable narration in some of Nabokov's works.

### Nonfiction

- _This is Water_ by David Foster Wallace[^5]
- _The Lords of Strategy_ by Walter Kiechel
- _The Burnout Society_ by Byung-Chul Han
- _Jean Baudrillard: From Marxism to Postmodernism and Beyond_ by Douglas
  Kellner
- _In the Ruins of Neoliberalism: The Rise of Antidemocratic Politics in the
  West_ by Wendy Brown
- _Letters to a Young Poet_ by Rainer Maria Rilke
- _The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities_ by John
  Mearsheimer

[^5]:
    Listening to [this
    speech](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water) was one of
    the ways to calm myself on the most dreadful of days during this year. It was
    pure meditation. I've lost track the number of times I've referred to this work.

[^6]:
    The article series was recommended by my friend Neel. In the month of
    August, I shilled this story beyond count. It provided much needed entertainment
    as I was job hunting.

[^7]:
    A really fun read, and also served as supplemental motivation to write
    this current piece. The primary impulse was my friend Rosanne. She wrote a
    review for her books back at the end of 2019. I somewhat followed suit, albeit
    [two months late](https://rexledesma.com/blog/through-the-ages-part1). I wanted
    to carry the habit to this year as well.

[^8]:
    How else could I fulfill my thirst for live music in our socially isolated
    present?

[^9]:
    I credit this channel for really opening up the world of critical theory
    and postmodern thought in my life. All of the videos on this channel are well
    researched and quite entertaining.

[^10]:
    [Brian Wong](https://twitter.com/brianwongopr), one of the founding
    members of the review, is a fantastic interviewer - his dynamic in coversations
    (especially with Žižek) is incredibly informative beyond entertaining!

[^11]:
    God, I just love this sort of movie analysis and commentary. Made me
    adore Satoshi Kon even more. [BREADSWORD](https://twitter.com/BREADSWORD) is
    pretty funny too.

[^12]: How could you not want to cycle after watching these beautiful videos?
[^13]:
    Yes, he gets his own section. I found most of his interviews compiled in
    [an audio project](http://www.dfwaudioproject.org/interviews-profiles/).

[^14]:
    I rewatched this movie after a [wonderful morning
    ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/3702781710) with my roommate Jeffrey.
    I'm honestly a sucker for the film's soundtrack. For me, the music is
    quintessentially the spirit of the year 2013.

[^15]:
    I watched this today, on New Year's Eve, while taking the plane from
    Durham to San Francisco! So heartfelt and emotional - the opening scene is
    brilliant.
